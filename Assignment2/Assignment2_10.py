"""

print("10" + "20")   # 1020
print(10 + 20)       # 30

# Answer
"""
In this print("10" + "20") both are string and we
are performing the + operation which is string concatenation
operation so resulting output is 1020.

In this print(10 + 20) both are integers and performing the simple 
numeric addition so the result is 30.
